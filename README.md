# connect4
A connect4 game with artificial intelligence capabilities. 

This project was for an introductory programming class at Davidson. My partner and I worked jointly on the Player.py file,
and were given the Board.py file, so that we would not have to worry about board set up. Our task was to implement the 
minimax algorithm- looking a certain number of moves ahead and determining the best move- using recursion and object oriented
programming. 

Later on, I made some changes to the console prompts for the user in the Board.py file. 

To run this code, have Python 3 or 2 set up on your computer, then copy and paste the Board.py and Player.py code into two 
separate files in the same directory, and run the Borad.py code. You will then be prompted in the console to play a game of 
connect 4.
